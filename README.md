# f5xc-appstack-aws

Experimental deployment of 3-node Appstack site in AWS plus worker nodes.

Clone this repo with `Clone this repo with: git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mwiget/f5xc-appstack-aws`

Open issues:

- worker nodes don't join the cluster yet
- requires to rename cluster.tf to cluster.tf.save for first run. Need to figure out proper way to deal with empty master and worker node list.
